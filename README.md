# CheckBalanced
Exercise related with Trees and Graphs.

## Exercise Challenge
Implement a function to check if a binary tree is balanced. 
For the purposes of this question, a balanced tree is defined to be a tree such that the heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one.

### Solution
I implemented an algorithm that does the following:
For each node, computes the right and left heights of the subtrees and checks if they only differ by one. 
It does it recursively for each node.
